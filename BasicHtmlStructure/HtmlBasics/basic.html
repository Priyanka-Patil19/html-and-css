    <p>Every day I see designers and developers working alongside one another. They work intelligently in pursuit of
        business objectives. They work diligently making exceptional products. They solve real problems and take pride
        in their work. They are builders. <a href="#">Continue&#8230;</a></p>

    <p>
        Aligning text is an important part of building a rhythm and flow on a page; we do this using the text-align
        property. The text-align property has five values: left, right, center, justify, and inherit. All of these
        values are fairly straightforward; as expected, they align text to the left, right, or center, or they justify
        text.
