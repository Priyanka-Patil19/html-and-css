    <p>Occasionally we may want to create a hyperlink to our email address—for example, hyperlink text that says “Email
        Me,” which when clicked opens a user’s default email client and pre-populates part of an email. At a minimum the
        email address to which the email is being sent is populated; other information such as a subject line and body
        text may also be included.

        To create an email link, the href attribute value needs to start with mailto: followed by the email address to
        which the email should be sent. To create an email link to shay@awesome.com, for example, the href attribute
        value would be mailto:shay@awesome.com.

        Additionally, subject, body text, and other information for the email may be populated. To add a subject line,
        we’ll include the subject= parameter after the email address. The first parameter following the email address
        must begin with a question mark, ?, to bind it to the hyperlink path. Multiple words within a subject line
        require that spaces be encoded using %20.

        Adding body text works in the same way as adding the subject, this time using the body= parameter in the href
        attribute value. Because we are binding one parameter to another we need to use the ampersand, &, to separate
        the two. As with the subject, spaces must be encoded using %20, and line breaks must be encoded using %0A.

        Altogether, a link to shay@awesome.com with the subject of “Reaching Out” and body text of “How are you” would
        require an href attribute value of mailto:shay@awesome.com?subject=Reaching%20Out&body=How%20are%20you.</p>
