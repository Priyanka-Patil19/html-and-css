    <title>using CSS Resets</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Every web browser has its own default styles for different elements. How Google Chrome renders headings,
        paragraphs, lists, and so forth may be different from how Internet Explorer does. To ensure cross-browser
        compatibility, CSS resets have become widely used.

        CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all
        browsers. These resets generally involve removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning
        these values down. Because CSS cascades from top to bottom—more on that soon—our reset needs to be at the very
        top of our style sheet. Doing so ensures that those styles are read first and that all of the different web
        browsers are working from a common baseline</p>
