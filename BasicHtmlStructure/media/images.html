    <p>Images come in a variety of different file formats, and each browser may support (or not support) different
        formats. By and large, the most commonly supported formats online are gif, jpg, and png images. Of these, the
        most widely used formats today are jpg and png. The jpg format provides quality images with high color counts
        while maintaining a decent file size, ideal for faster load times. The png format is great for images with
        transparencies or low color counts. We most commonly see jpg images used for photographs and png images used for
        icons or background patterns.</p>
