    <div id="main">Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its
        container to the left and right. Then, you can set the left and right margins to auto to horizontally center
        that element within its container. The element will take up the width you specify, then the remaining space will
        be split evenly between the two margins.

        The only problem occurs when the browser window is narrower than the width of your element. The browser resolves

        this by creating a horizontal scrollbar on the page. Let's improve the situation...</div>
    <div class="simple">I am simple</div>
    <div class="fancy">I am fancy</div>

    <div class="static">static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special
        way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said
        to be positioned.</div>

    <div class="realative1">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</div>
        <div class="fixed">Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet</div>
