    <!-- <p>Exactly how elements are displayed—as block-level elements, inline elements, or something else—is determined by
        the display property. Every element has a default display property value; however, as with all other property
        values, that value may be overwritten. There are quite a few values for the display property, but the most
        common are block, inline, inline-block, and none.

        We can change an element’s display property value by selecting that element within CSS and declaring a new
        display property value. A value of block will make that element a block-level element.</p> -->
